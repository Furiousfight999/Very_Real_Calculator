# This is a simple "Calculator" that uses Powershell

This program requires Cisco Packet tracer in order to be fully functional. I recommend using version 8.2.2 to avoid any issues with compatability that may come up (I used version 8.2.2)


Just so you know, when asking for an operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide, or sacrifice to the mesh network. if you type anything other than the numbers listed the script will start from the beggining)

I was bored so I made this in powershell, and then I got bored and remade it in python as well


if you have a different version of cisco packet tracer downloaded, try and run it. It may or may not work.
